; Exercise 2.4.  Here is an alternative procedural representation of pairs. For this representation, verify that (car (cons x y)) yields x for any objects x and y.

(define (cons x y)
  (lambda (m) (m x y)))

(define (car z)
  (z (lambda (p q) p)))

; What is the corresponding definition of cdr? (Hint: To verify that this works, make use of the substitution model of section 1.1.5.)

(car (cons x y))
(car (lambda (m) (m x y)))
((lambda (m) (m x y)) (lambda (p q) p))
((lambda (p q) p) x y)
x
